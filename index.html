					<h1>SCHOOL, BOOKS, PRODUCTIVITY</h1>
					<h2>Hello there, you might be wondering who am I. I am not a big speaker or poet but I am a student. My name is Kamran and this is my blog. A law aspirant with the dream of studying in NLUD. I am currently studying in class 12th in Government Boys Higher Secondary Soura.
					I have made this blog myself with no help from web designing sites like Wordpress. I am new to coding, book reading and writing poetry, though I don't want to try  the last one yet.
					A Forever Business Novus customer who hasn't completed his 2cc. 
					I don't make websites but if you like my blog, I can make one for you for extremely low price, 
					which will be negotiable.

				<h2>Life In The Quarantine</h2>
				<p>We the people of Kashmir are extremely resilient to lockdown because we are always locked in our homes by the Indian forces. However this lockdown has even hit me and made me mad because of high stress. This time I am not able to even go outside my home which was not the case in earlier lockdowns and curfews. I hate staying at home too much because it makes me feel that I have different diseases. Those diseases are just the product of anxiety which develops by staying at home too much. I try to pass time in this lockdown by reading some books. I am just a beginner reader but in case you want my suggestions for books, you can click in the link below to see my favourites.<br>
				I also used to play PUBG mobile but now hate playing it mainly because its too boring.<br>
				I am a casual PC gamer and I mainly play Skyrim, Far Cry 5, and other RPGs. I  also recommend Resident Evil 7-Biohazard since its the only game that I have completed.<br>
				I haven't written poetry yet so that tab is useless but I plan to do it in the near future.<br>
				Also quotes page might be full of junk so beware of that.<br> <br>
